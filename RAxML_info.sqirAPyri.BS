RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_boot.sqirAPyri onto tree in file RAxML_result.sqirAPyri.RUN.100


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -f b -m GTRCAT -z RAxML_boot.sqirAPyri -t RAxML_result.sqirAPyri.RUN.100 -n sqirAPyri.BS 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_result.sqirAPyri.RUN.100



Found 500 trees in File RAxML_boot.sqirAPyri
